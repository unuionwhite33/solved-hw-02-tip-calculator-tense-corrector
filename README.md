Description:

For your second homework assignment you are required to write two separate Java programs, ​<strong>TipCalculator.java</strong>​ ​and​ ​<strong>TenseCorrector.java</strong>​, ​that will prompt users to provide certain information which the program will process and produce an output according to its functions respectively.

<ol>

 <li>Task 1: Tip Calculator​</li>

 <li>Task 2: ​Tense Corrector</li>

</ol>




<h1>Task 1: Tip Calculator</h1>

This program uses the Scanner class to prompt users for an amount to be paid by the user in US dollars (a ​<strong>double</strong>​) and the percentage of tip the user is willing to give (an ​<strong>int</strong>​). The base amount (a ​<strong>double</strong>​), tip amount alone (a ​<strong>double</strong>​), and the total amount to be paid (a <strong>double</strong>​) should then be produced as an output on the console as shown on the example below. It is important to follow the format closely.




Example/Demonstration:




<strong>Price($): </strong>​<strong>200 </strong>

<strong>Tip Percentage(%):</strong> ​ ​<strong>15 </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Price Without Tip($): 200.00 </strong>

<strong>Tip Amount($): 30.00 </strong>

<strong>Total Amount($): 230.00</strong>

<strong> </strong>




<h1>Task 2: Tense Corrector</h1>

This program uses the Scanner class to prompt users for a sentence with possible grammatical errors in it (a String). The program will then manipulate the given string by replacing all the words in the table below into their past tense. You will only be checked for the successful conversion of these given words. The “corrected” sentence (a String) will then be displayed on the console in the next line as shown below.
